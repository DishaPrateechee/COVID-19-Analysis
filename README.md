# COVID-19-Analysis
This is a project I did to analyse the deaths that occurred due to COVID-19 based on the available data set.

* Data was taken from the Kaggle dataset.
* This is an attempt to analyse the given data on COVID-19 death and recovery toll to figure how better to cater to the individuals affected by it.
* The below analysis can help determine the priority of the health care that need to be provided to an individual based on different parameters.
* The Project Write-up is published on Github - 

* Based on the analysis, the individuals with ages more than 90 were more likely to be infected by COVID-19

* On further analysis on gender significance, male individuals affected with Corona virus are more likely to die of the same than the females.

* Based on the dataset available, the recovery is seen more within the age group of 30-40 than in any other age groups.
